# Catch the Chennai Express
A small clone of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://pallavi93.github.io/chennaiexpress/)
Tiles are SRK's movies in chronological order. Join tiles of similar movies to create a new tile. And finally catch the Chennai Express.

Gabiele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means no hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`. Thank you very much!
